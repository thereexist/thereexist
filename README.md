- 👋 Hi, I’m @thereexist
- 👀 I’m interested in science.
- 🌱 I analyzed MD simulation data by [Julia language](https://julialang.org/). Currently, this result is published in [JPCL](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c00323). 
- 🍭 I’m currently learning reversible reaction process by theory and double check this result based on the stochastic simulation by c lang.
- 🎇 I like bike riding, bodyweight workouts (pull-up, push up), and reading books. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 I'm Ph.D student in [**CDLC**](http://cdlc.cau.ac.kr/). 
- 📕 I'm a member of the [**Kwanjeong Book Club**](https://sites.google.com/view/sogul/home).
